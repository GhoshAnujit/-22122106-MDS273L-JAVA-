In this program, we read a text file through java, and return multiple results to the user, these include- 

1. Vowels and their count 
2. Digits and their count 
3. Top five repeated words and their count 
4. Least five repeated words and their count 
5. Top five repeated characters and their count 
6. Least five repeated characters and their count 

We are using the attached text file, and different functions to implement the six functions asked, we pass the file content to the functions ans return the values accordingly, use of global variables is restricted.
