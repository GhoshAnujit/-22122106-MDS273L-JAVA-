This Program depicts the use of a menu driven program in java, we take Names as input from user and give him the option to search for a name in the list, 
remove a name from the list, or look at all the names present in the list. The names are stored in an array of fixed length, with unique entries, and the array is resized
after the removal of any objects from it, so no empty spaces are allowed.
